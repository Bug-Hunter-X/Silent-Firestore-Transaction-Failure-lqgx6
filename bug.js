In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't being written to Firestore even though my code appeared correct.  The write operation didn't throw any errors, leading to a difficult debugging process. The problem was related to the way I was handling transactions, specifically how I was referencing the documents within the transaction.  I was using the wrong method of retrieving the document, causing the updates to fail silently.
